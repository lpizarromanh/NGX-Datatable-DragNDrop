# NGX-Datatable-DragNDrop
Drag and drop taken from https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-datatable/issues/411#issuecomment-340792345

## Why
I needed drag and drop, really liked the style of NGX-Datatable, and liked dragula.

## How do I use?
- Install dragula into your project.
- Include dragula extended file in this repo.
- Follow along with my two code snippets, yes they may seem incomplete, I stripped out quite a bit of stuff (privacy reasons).

## Having issues?
Follow this issue: https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-datatable/issues/411#issuecomment-340792345 first before asking it here.
